TODO: Maybe use a digraph per pc to keep the digraphs small and boost
search efficiency in pm_pdp?

TODO: Something with resgistering processes the erlang way.

TODO: Review handling processes. Double bookkeeping with the P table
and the PU list in the process state.

TODO: While defining prohibitions, it would be nice to store the type
of the prohibited attributes (oa or ua) in the definition. Currently,
the type to look for is determined when executing the prohinitions in
the PDP.

TODO: In determining the key of a set or sequence, we use the erlang
phash2 function with a 2^32 range. This is considerated a small range.
Maybe, ATI and ATE sets should get unique id's since it is not likely
that these sets contain the same elements. AR sets do however contain
a lilimited set of elements and are likely to be the same. Also, ATI
and ATE sets are used in prohibitions and are for that reason less
frequently used.
