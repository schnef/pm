pm (Policy Machine)
=====

Policy Machine Erlang implementation. This is pre-pre-pre-alpha and likely to
disappear again soon.  See [the policy machine
overview]{http://csrc.nist.gov/pm/} for more information or read the
specs from [NISTIR 7987rev. 1]{http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2015/NIST.IR.7987r1.pdf}.

This version is used to play with some of the ideas the PM tries to
implement. It is of no practical use as it is now.
